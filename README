Carl - Carl Analyzes RSync Logfiles
-----------------------------------

This is Carl. Carl analyzes rsync logfiles and creates a top ten
list of users (or rather: IPs) both regarding volume and number of
sessions. 

Carl can be installed using the distutils method ("python setup.py install")
or it can be run from its directory.

Carl automatically uses Psyco if it is installed.

The newest version is available here:

Have fun.
